# Turtle Race
This is a python game consisting of a race between 2 to 10 turtles using the modules **graphics.py** and **button.py** from John M. Zelle. (I added a function to button.py)

You can choose how many laps do you want to race, it will output the winner of each lap and the overall winner of the race, if it's a tie just click the 'Tiebreaker' button to decide the winner. After each race you can choose to restart the game.

## Limitations
Filling entry boxes whit invalid characters will break the program.

## Contributions
Special thanks to my fianc√©e and my brother for all the good ideas.
